            <h2>Why Prague?</h2>
            <h3>Prague, the city of a hundred spires</h3>
            <p>
              A prosperous and bustling city, Prague now attracts more tourists
              than ever. But its picturesque downtown veils both a dark legacy
              and a resilient past. Dating back to about A.D. 870, Prague has
              withstood numerous overthrows, invasions, fires and floods. It's
              this reputation for survival and perseverance that has made the
              Czech capital so fascinating. Today, its storied churches, narrow
              streets, daunting hilltop castle and statue-lined bridges create
              the scene of an urban fairy tale. Even the most jaded traveler
              would have trouble resisting this city's charms.
            </p>
            <p>
              Prague was once a hidden gem, overshadowed by its flashier
              neighbors to the west. But the city couldn't keep its marvels a
              secret for too long now, it's a haven for travelers seeking
              awe-inspiring experiences at affordable prices. Even today, top
              attractions including the famous Charles Bridge and the historic
              Prague Castle offer free admission and many hotels offer rooms at
              a fraction of the cost of other European cities. But this
              bargain-hunting legacy has a ticking clock on it, so if you're
              hoping to find a fire-sale price, now's the time to do so.
